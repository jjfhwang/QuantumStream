# QuantumStream: A Go-Based Probabilistic Data Stream Processor

QuantumStream is a high-performance, horizontally scalable data stream processing framework built in Go. It leverages probabilistic data structures to efficiently estimate aggregates and statistics over unbounded data streams, enabling real-time insights with minimal resource consumption. Unlike traditional stream processing engines that require storing every element, QuantumStream provides approximate answers with configurable accuracy, trading off absolute precision for speed and scalability. This makes it ideally suited for monitoring, anomaly detection, and trend analysis in high-velocity, high-volume data environments where precise accuracy is less critical than rapid response.

The core purpose of QuantumStream is to provide a lightweight and flexible platform for extracting meaningful information from continuous data flows. It achieves this by implementing a variety of probabilistic algorithms, including Bloom filters for membership testing, Count-Min Sketch for frequency estimation, and HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation. These algorithms are carefully optimized for performance and memory efficiency, allowing QuantumStream to handle massive data streams on commodity hardware. The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to easily integrate new probabilistic algorithms and data sources. Furthermore, QuantumStream is built with horizontal scalability in mind, enabling users to distribute the processing load across multiple nodes to handle even the most demanding workloads.

QuantumStream distinguishes itself from other stream processing solutions through its commitment to resource efficiency and probabilistic accuracy. While exact computation demands significant resources for large datasets, QuantumStream sacrifices a small degree of precision for substantially reduced memory footprint and processing time. This approach allows it to handle data volumes and velocities that would be intractable for traditional methods. Its Go implementation ensures high performance and concurrency, and its well-defined API simplifies integration into existing data pipelines. By embracing probabilistic algorithms, QuantumStream offers a powerful and cost-effective solution for real-time data analysis in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Features

*   **Probabilistic Data Structures:** Implements Bloom filters, Count-Min Sketch, and HyperLogLog for approximate membership testing, frequency estimation, and cardinality estimation respectively.
    *   *Technical Detail:* Bloom filters provide a space-efficient probabilistic set data structure that supports membership queries. Count-Min Sketch estimates the frequency of elements in a data stream with configurable error bounds. HyperLogLog estimates the cardinality of a dataset with a standard error that decreases as the number of registers increases.
*   **Configurable Accuracy:** Allows users to fine-tune the accuracy and memory usage of probabilistic algorithms based on specific application requirements.
    *   *Technical Detail:* Error rate and confidence intervals can be specified during the initialization of each probabilistic data structure, providing granular control over the trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption.
*   **Horizontal Scalability:** Designed for distributed processing across multiple nodes, enabling handling of massive data streams.
    *   *Technical Detail:* The framework supports sharding of data streams based on consistent hashing, ensuring even distribution of the processing load across available nodes.
*   **Go Concurrency:** Leverages Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) for efficient parallel processing of data streams.
    *   *Technical Detail:* Data streams are processed concurrently using goroutines, with channels used for communication and synchronization between different processing stages.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Enables easy integration of new probabilistic algorithms and data sources.
    *   *Technical Detail:* The framework defines a well-defined interface for probabilistic data structures and data sources, allowing developers to easily implement and integrate custom components.
*   **Lightweight and Efficient:** Optimized for minimal resource consumption, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
    *   *Technical Detail:* The Go implementation and careful optimization of probabilistic algorithms ensure a minimal memory footprint and efficient processing, allowing QuantumStream to run on commodity hardware.
*   **Simple API:** Provides a straightforward API for interacting with the framework and integrating it into existing data pipelines.
    *   *Technical Detail:* The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly integrate QuantumStream into their existing data processing workflows.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go (Golang):** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, concurrency capabilities, and ease of deployment. Go's built-in concurrency features and efficient memory management are crucial for handling high-volume data streams.
*   **Consistent Hashing:** Used for sharding data streams across multiple nodes in a distributed environment. Ensures even distribution of the processing load and minimizes data movement during scaling.
*   **Protocol Buffers (Optional):** Can be used for serializing and deserializing data streams, enabling efficient data transfer between different components. Enables schema evolution and language-agnostic communication.
*   **gRPC (Optional):** Can be used for inter-node communication in a distributed deployment. Provides a high-performance and scalable communication framework.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the QuantumStream repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumStream.git
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    cd QuantumStream
4.  **Build the Project:**

    go build .
5.  **Install Dependencies:** If using Protocol Buffers or gRPC, install the necessary dependencies:

## Configuration

QuantumStream can be configured through environment variables and command-line flags. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_PORT`: The port number on which the QuantumStream server will listen (default: 8080).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_DATA_DIR`: The directory where data will be stored (default: /tmp/quantumstream).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE`: The size of the Bloom filter in bits (default: 1000000).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_BLOOM_FILTER_ERROR_RATE`: The desired error rate of the Bloom filter (default: 0.01).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_COUNT_MIN_SKETCH_WIDTH`: The width of the Count-Min Sketch (default: 1000).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_COUNT_MIN_SKETCH_DEPTH`: The depth of the Count-Min Sketch (default: 5).
*   `QUANTUMSTREAM_HYPERLOGLOG_REGISTERS`: The number of registers used by HyperLogLog (default: 1024).

These variables can be set using the `export` command in your shell. For example:

export QUANTUMSTREAM_PORT=9000

Command-line flags can also be used to override the default values. Run the `quantumstream -help` command to see a list of available flags.

## Usage

QuantumStream provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the framework. The CLI supports the following commands:

*   `bloom`: Operations related to Bloom filters (add, check).

    ./quantumstream bloom add "example"
    ./quantumstream bloom check "example"
*   `countmin`: Operations related to Count-Min Sketch (increment, query).

    ./quantumstream countmin increment "example"
    ./quantumstream countmin query "example"
*   `hyperloglog`: Operations related to HyperLogLog (add, estimate).

    ./quantumstream hyperloglog add "example"
    ./quantumstream hyperloglog estimate

For more detailed API documentation, refer to the `docs` directory in the repository (currently under development). The API is designed around interacting with these probabilistic data structures to efficiently process data streams. Examples of using these from within Go code are also forthcoming in the documentation.
