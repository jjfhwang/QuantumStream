# QuantumStream: Decentralized Crypto-Asset Workflow Orchestration

QuantumStream empowers developers to build sophisticated, automated workflows for managing crypto-assets by leveraging serverless functions and blockchain event-driven smart contract interactions.

This project provides a framework for creating decentralized applications (dApps) that react to on-chain events and trigger custom logic through serverless functions. Imagine a scenario where a smart contract deposit triggers a notification, initiates a KYC verification process, and automatically allocates tokens to a user's account  all without manual intervention. QuantumStream makes this possible by providing a robust and secure bridge between blockchain events and off-chain computation. The core value proposition lies in its ability to streamline complex crypto-asset management processes, reduce operational overhead, and improve the overall user experience. It facilitates the development of highly scalable and resilient dApps that can seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise systems. QuantumStream promotes a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily adapt and extend the platform to support diverse use cases, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to supply chain management and identity verification solutions.

QuantumStream's architecture focuses on loosely coupled components, ensuring that the system remains flexible and adaptable to evolving blockchain technologies. By utilizing serverless functions, the platform can dynamically scale resources based on demand, minimizing infrastructure costs and maximizing efficiency. The event-driven nature of the system allows for real-time responses to blockchain activities, enabling developers to create applications that are both proactive and reactive. Furthermore, QuantumStream incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access, making it a reliable solution for handling valuable crypto-assets. The project aims to foster innovation within the blockchain ecosystem by providing a powerful and easy-to-use tool for building next-generation decentralized applications.

QuantumStream is designed to be accessible to developers of varying skill levels, with comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users through the process of building and deploying their own custom workflows. The platform supports a variety of blockchain protocols and serverless function providers, allowing developers to choose the technologies that best suit their needs. By abstracting away the complexities of blockchain integration and serverless function management, QuantumStream empowers developers to focus on building the core logic of their applications, accelerating development cycles and reducing time to market. The platform provides a unified interface for managing all aspects of the workflow orchestration process, from defining event triggers to deploying and monitoring serverless functions.

## Key Features

*   **Blockchain Event Listeners:** Utilizes a robust event listener module built in Go to subscribe to specific events emitted by smart contracts on various blockchain networks (currently supports Ethereum, but extensible to others). The listener decodes event data and publishes it to a message queue.
*   **Serverless Function Triggers:** Integrates with popular serverless function platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) to trigger functions based on messages received from the message queue. This allows developers to write custom logic in various programming languages (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.).
*   **Smart Contract Interaction API:** Provides a Go library for interacting with smart contracts, including deploying contracts, calling functions, and sending transactions. This library handles gas estimation, transaction signing, and error handling.
*   **Workflow Orchestration Engine:** Includes a lightweight workflow engine to define and manage complex workflows involving multiple serverless function calls and smart contract interactions. Workflows are defined using a simple JSON-based format.
*   **Security and Access Control:** Implements robust security measures, including role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption of sensitive data. Secure key management is handled using HashiCorp Vault.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Provides comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to track the performance of workflows and identify potential issues. Logs are aggregated and stored in Elasticsearch for easy analysis.
*   **Cross-Chain Compatibility (Planned):** Future development will include support for cross-chain communication and interoperability, allowing workflows to span multiple blockchain networks.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The core of QuantumStream is written in Go, providing performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Ethereum (go-ethereum):** Used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, including listening to events and sending transactions.
*   **gRPC:** Enables communication between different components of the system, providing a fast and efficient way to exchange data.
*   **Redis:** Serves as a message queue for passing event data between the event listener and the serverless function triggers.
*   **AWS Lambda (or similar):** Serverless function platform used to execute custom logic in response to blockchain events.
*   **HashiCorp Vault:** Used for secure storage and management of cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
*   **Elasticsearch/Kibana:** Used for aggregating, storing, and analyzing logs and metrics.

## Installation

1.  **Install Go:** Download and install Go from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/). Ensure that your `GOPATH` and `PATH` environment variables are correctly configured.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumStream.git`
    `cd QuantumStream`

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    `go mod download`
    `go mod tidy`

4.  **Install Redis:** Download and install Redis from [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download). Ensure that Redis is running on the default port (6379).

5.  **Install HashiCorp Vault (Optional):** If you plan to use Vault for key management, download and install it from [https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads). Configure Vault according to your security requirements.

6.  **Build the Application:**
    `go build -o quantumstream cmd/quantumstream/main.go`

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables. Here are some of the key environment variables:

*   `BLOCKCHAIN_ENDPOINT`: The URL of the Ethereum node to connect to (e.g., `wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`).
*   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the smart contract to monitor.
*   `REDIS_ADDRESS`: The address of the Redis server (e.g., `localhost:6379`).
*   `VAULT_ADDRESS`: The address of the HashiCorp Vault server (e.g., `http://localhost:8200`).
*   `VAULT_TOKEN`: The Vault token used for authentication.
*   `SERVERLESS_FUNCTION_URL`: The URL of the serverless function to trigger.

You can set these environment variables in your shell or create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

## Usage

1.  **Start the QuantumStream application:**
    `./quantumstream`

    This will start the event listener and begin monitoring the specified smart contract for events.

2.  **Deploy a Smart Contract:** Deploy the smart contract you want to monitor to the configured blockchain endpoint.

3.  **Configure a Serverless Function:** Create a serverless function that accepts JSON payloads as input. The payload will contain the event data from the smart contract.

    Example serverless function (Node.js):

    

4.  **Define a Workflow (Optional):** For more complex workflows, you can define a workflow using a JSON-based format. The workflow engine will orchestrate the execution of multiple serverless functions and smart contract interactions.

    Example Workflow (JSON):
